 			<h2> Internet...what is it? </h2>
 			<div>
 				<p>Internet is a global network of computer systems. Communicating by sending long string messages encoded as electrical signals across cables. Thats obvious but what does that mean to you? </p>
 				<p> In most web development, we only care about the top layer of the internet -- The Application layer. Here we deal with the HTTP protocol. HTTP is short for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. Essentially, this is how we send text across the Net. For example, when you type in <a href="http://google.com"> google.com </a> into your browser. What you are actually sending is <a href="http://google.com"> http://www.google.com </a>. Notice the http:// in front? that is the http protocol. There are other application layer protocols : git, fts, ssh and many others. We may use some of them but for the most part we use http and its more secured offspring https. </p>
